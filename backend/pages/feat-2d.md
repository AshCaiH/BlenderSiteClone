<p>Really! Drawing directly in a 3D viewport makes a lot of sense. It opens unsurpassed workflow freedom for story-boarders and 2D artists.

<ul>
    <li>Combine 2D with 3D right in the viewport</li>
    <li>Full Animation Support with Onion Skinning</li>
    <li>Layers & Colors for Stroke and Fill</li>
    <li>Sculpt brush strokes & Parent to 3D objects</li>
</ul>
